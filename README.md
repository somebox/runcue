# RunCue

> **runcue** provides the cues and coordination to run tasks many tasks at once — monitoring dependencies, rate limits, retries, and progress, so you only need to define the workloads.

A Python library for coordinating work across rate-limited services, remote hosts, and external processes. Acts as an **air traffic controller** — it doesn't run the heavy computation itself, but dispatches work to external systems (AI APIs, SSH hosts, batch processors) and tracks completion.
